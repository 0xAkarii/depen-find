# DEPEN-FIND - NPM Dependency Validator

DEPEN-FIND is a tool designed to validate NPM dependencies and check their availability in the NPM registry. This tool is specifically built to help developers identify potential vulnerabilities related to **Dependency Confusion Attacks** by ensuring that all dependencies listed in a `package.json` or `package-lock.json` file exist in the official NPM registry.

## Features
- Fetches dependency lists from a **GitHub URL** or a **local file**.
- Checks whether each dependency exists in the **NPM registry**.
- Displays results in a structured table format.
- Helps prevent **Dependency Confusion Attacks** by identifying missing or potentially unsafe dependencies.

## Installation
Ensure you have Python installed on your system, then install the required dependencies:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Run the script and provide a **GitHub URL** or a **file path** to `package.json` or `package-lock.json`:

```sh
python depen_find.py
```

Example input:

- **Using a GitHub URL:**
  ```
  Enter the URL or file path of package.json or package-lock.json: https://github.com/user/repo/blob/main/package.json
  ```
- **Using a local file:**
  ```
  Enter the URL or file path of package.json or package-lock.json: /path/to/package.json
  ```

## Contribution
Contributions are welcome! Feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request to improve the tool.
